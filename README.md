**Legend of Hakr**

A Multiplayer Text Based Hacking Game.

This application requires PHP 5.6 or higher and mySQL, and uses the CodeIgniter framework. The application/config/database.php file has been excluded from this project, so you will need to create one that matches your mySQL database credentials. (check the codeigniter offical repo for this file)
The database structure is provided as hakr-database-schema.sql  Just create a new database and import this file. Put the credentials in your codeigniter database.php and... you should be good to go! 

This project is currently in development, and is expected to eventually release on Android. Pull requests and forks are welcome.
